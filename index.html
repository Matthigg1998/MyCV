      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <p>IT has been for the most part a big factor in my life. I've always wanted to learn more even from a young age.
         I have spent a large majority of my life learning about the different forms of Computer knowledge and I will keep dedicating my life to learning the forever changing industry. 
        
         Working deligently and paying close attention to detail is what I excell at. There are aspects of my work ethic that I am currently working on but I am only human. 
        On more hobby side of things I enjoy music, movies and a few games here and there if time allows it. 

        I tired my hand in the sound industry but quickly found that it was an industry that I was not designed for.
